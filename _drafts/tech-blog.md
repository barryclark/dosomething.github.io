NEED A HOOK FIRST. (start with the argument for having it all in the one place and then disprove it?)

We have a "dev roundtable" each week where we eat lunch together and one of us presents on a project that we've been working on recently, or something useful that we've learned and want to share.

Recent examples include:

- Architecture for our nodejs/RabbitMQ message broker system
- A prototype of our website in React
- How we use Twine JS to build a CMS for our SMS games
- An overview of the best presentations at JSConf
- ZSH tips and tricks
- A high level code walkthrough for our internal iOS app

Two important points about these meetings:

### 1. They're highly technical—they're for engineers

Anyone in our organization is welcome to come, but they'd likely be bored half to death with the presentation gets nerdy. For our engineering team, digging into how things were built is what we find to be extremely valuable—and what we enjoy!

### 2. Transparency

They promote transparency and sharing across our team. This is especially valuable as our team grows and we aren't able to keep track of every pull request that's opened.

Hanging out and eating together is fun too!

## Our engineering blog does the same—except externally

If you're anything like us at DoSomething, we ship a lot of awesome code and projects.

In any given sprint it's possible that we have:

- Launched a new open source project.
- Prototyped something out with a new tool or framework to get a feel for it.
- Learned important engineering lessons during product development.

We realized that we're working away, banging the gong when we ship things, and noone gets to see all of the awesome work that our team is putting out there.

> Nobody's aware of our awesomeness until we externalize it.

There are a number of ways to do this, conferences, open source projects, but one of the lowest lifts possible is through our tech blog.
